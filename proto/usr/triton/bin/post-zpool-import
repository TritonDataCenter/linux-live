# The /etc/systemd/network/*.link files are processed as a result of udev add
# events.  systemd-udevd needs to start way early and those add events happened
# a long time ago.  Let's trigger them again.
#
# Ideally, we would use the `-w` option to `udevadm trigger`.  That can hang
# forever when a link is renamed, presumably because it is waiting for an event
# that includes the old name.  Instead, we fire off the first command then wait
# for all events - even those unrelated to the trigger - to finish.  This isn't
# realy a big deal, I think.

# XXX-linuxcn: file a ticket at https://github.com/systemd/systemd.
