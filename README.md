# linux-live

This repo will hold the things that go into making the Linux platform image.

[debian-live](tools/debian-live) creates an ISO image that contains Debian with
ZFS.

Documentation can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.  Some of this is likely
to last a while and some of it is capturing current areas of exploration.
