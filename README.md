This repo will hold the things that go into making the Linux platform image.

[debian-live](tools/debian-live) creates an iso image that contains debian with
ZFS 0.8.3.  While this automation can be distributed, the output of it cannot
due to GPL/CDDL issues.

Documentation can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.  Some of this is likely
to last a while and some of it is capturing current areas of exploration.
